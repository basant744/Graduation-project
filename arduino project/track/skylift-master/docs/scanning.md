Scanning instructions

## Setup and test your iOS Device (5 min)

First you'll need to install a utility app (from Apple) to do a Wi-Fi scan

1. Install Airport Utility: <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airport-utility/id427276530?mt=8>
1. on iPhone go to “Settings > AirPort Utility (towards bottom) > WiFi Scanner (enable)
1. Open "AirPort Utility” app from home screen and press “Wi-Fi Scan"
1. Set Scan duration for 20 seconds
1. Click “Scan” and wait for scan to complete
1. Click the [ ^ ] button at bottom left and then you can email me the scan data
1. Please add "Scan #"" to the subject so I know which location


## Add GPS Data

Next, you'll need to know where in the world the scan is from. To get the GPS coordinates you can use Apple Maps. Perhaps Google Maps also works for this.

1. Open "Maps" on iOS
2. Click "(i)" in upper right
3. Click "Mark My Location"
4. Swipe up the location section
5. Click [^] share button
6. Click "Copy"
7. Paste this info into the note 
8. (it's a big long ugly URL, but it contains the lat/lon)

It's works well to save both of these as Notes on iOS device. Just make sure to label each one so I can match the GPS location to the Wi-Fi data.

## Multi-Position Scan

Usually about 5 scans are needed.

Below is an example of a 5-point scan. The distance between each scan should be about 25-100 ft (indoor) or 100-300 ft (outdoor)

## Random Info

- it's not possible to know that someone is scanning since you're phone is already doing this all the time
- to securely send notes: convert to text files and send over Signal
- I've do this whenever I go to an interesting place. Think of it like a Wi-Fi photo snapshot for your journal :)
